# belly-button-challenge

This coding challenge involves data analysis implementing interactive visualizations through the use of coding environments and tools including JavaScript, D3, Plotly, and HTML.

The codeset includes building out an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. For each subject, this dashboard displays demographic information, a bar chart of top 10 bacteria cultures found, and a bubble chart showing the number of bacteria cultures per sample.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
